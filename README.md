# Wb simulation models
Simulation to generate genetic sequence data for specific life history of Wuchereria bancrofti.
### To Do
* transmission_init and transmission_fx need to be coded as numpy matrix
* add selection
* output and record stats/analysis
* translate haplotypes store in meta_popdict to sequence as either vcf or fasta
