# Filarial worm Genetic Simulations *(FiGS)*
There are currently no available simulation models that generate population genetic data for filarial worms. Population genetic data can be used to infer specific life history characterisitcs of filarial worm populations and track the response and progress of elimination efforts. FiGS is a forward-in-time simulation written in python to generate genetic data under the specfic life history of *W. bancrofti*. FiGS is currently being used to identify sutaible population genetic summary statistics for evaluating elimination progression. Although written specifically for *W. bancrofti*, it is probably tunable to other filarial worms by altering the historical demographic parameters in the coalescent functions.

# Documentation
## Dependencies
Anaconda will install all dependencies as well as scrm (e.g., conda install -c bioconda scrm), pylibseq (conda install -c bioconda pylibseq), and scikit-allel (conda install -c conda-forge scikit-allel). scikit-allel is only used for post-processing, absence will not affect the compiling of FiGS but may error on some plots.
* [scrm](https://scrm.github.io/)
* [scikit-allel](https://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [pylibseq](https://github.com/molpopgen/pylibseq)
* scipy, numpy, KDTree, pandas, matplotlib, cython, seaborn

## Options
All options can be set via either config file or command line. The most relevant options are listed below. Full options are available in the config file: **wbsims.cfg**. I wouldnt recommend altering any default options other than what is listed below (since this is what we tested) and you do so at your own risk of indecipherable errors.

#### Host Demography
* villages: number of villages to simulate
* host population size: population of each village
* prevalence: initial prevalence of infection
* host migration rates: movement of hosts between villages

#### Vector
* biting rates: bites per person per hour
* biting times: avg exposure to biting

#### Genetic
* number of loci: how many loci to simulate
* length of loci: how many basepairs. scrm can handle Mb size loci with recombination
* mutation and recombination rates: locus specific
* selection: use selection function for resistance

#### Intervention
* mass drug administration: simulate with mda
* bed nets: simulate with bed nets

#### Data recording
* demography: formatted to R dataframe
* population genetic: summary statistics from pylibseq
* genetic data: output all or sample as vcf

*To Do: i) Density dependent fecundity and survival*
